# 1. Goal

In this phase, we build:

```text
Multi Client Server
```

Purpose:

```text
Support many TCP clients concurrently.
```

This continues the MiniRedis journey from a simple parser/store into a real Redis-like backend component.

---

# 2. What We Built Previously

Earlier phases gave us:

```text
001 TCP server
002 RESP parser
003 in-memory store
```

Then each later phase adds one production capability.

Current mental model:

```text
Client command
      |
      v
Parser
      |
      v
Command object
      |
      v
Command executor
      |
      v
Redis-like internal engine
      |
      v
Response
```

---

# 3. Previous Limitation

```text
The server handled one client at a time. A slow client could block everyone else.
```

This limitation matters because production Redis is not only a `Map`.

It also needs:

```text
correct command behavior
memory control
expiration
persistence
concurrency
replication
sharding
observability
```

---

# 4. What We Build In This Phase

We add:

```text
We create one handler thread per client so multiple clients can issue commands simultaneously.
```

Commands or operations covered:

```text
multiple clients
SET
GET
```

---

# 5. Why This Phase Matters

This phase matters because it connects implementation to real backend systems.

Real systems need:

```text
feature correctness
clear data structures
predictable complexity
safe failure handling
production debugging
scalability path
```

MiniRedis teaches these in small increments.

---

Phase flow:

```text

  -> validate
  -> execute Multi Client Server
  -> update internal state
  -> return output
```

# 7. File Structure

Recommended structure:

```text
MiniRedis/
└── src/
    └── main/
        └── java/
            └── com/
                └── miniredis/
                    ├── protocol/
                    ├── command/
                    ├── storage/
                    ├── server/
                    ├── persistence/
                    ├── cluster/
                    ├── metrics/
                    └── driver/
```

For this phase, keep only the needed packages.

# 8. Complete Java Code


## 8.1 `MiniRedisServer.java`

### Logic before this class

The server accepts clients.

In this phase, every client is handled without blocking all other clients.

For thread-pool phase, command work is submitted to `ExecutorService`.

```java
package com.miniredis.server;

import java.io.*;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class MiniRedisServer {
    private final int port;
    private final ExecutorService clientPool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
    private final ExecutorService commandPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);

    public MiniRedisServer(int port) {
        this.port = port;
    }

    public void start() throws IOException {
        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port)) {
            System.out.println("MiniRedis server started on port " + port);

            while (true) {
                Socket client = serverSocket.accept();
                clientPool.submit(() -> handleClient(client));
            }
        }
    }

    private void handleClient(Socket client) {
        try (
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(client.getInputStream()));
            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(client.getOutputStream(), true)
        ) {
            String line;

            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                String commandLine = line;

                commandPool.submit(() -> {
                    String response = execute(commandLine);
                    writer.println(response);
                });
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Client error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    private String execute(String commandLine) {
        if (commandLine.equalsIgnoreCase("PING")) {
            return "PONG";
        }

        return "OK received: " + commandLine;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        new MiniRedisServer(6379).start();
    }
}
```

---

## 8.2 `Phase011Driver.java`

### Logic before this class

The server itself has the main method.

Run it, then connect using telnet or netcat.

```java
package com.miniredis.driver;

import com.miniredis.server.MiniRedisServer;

public class Phase011Driver {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        new MiniRedisServer(6379).start();
    }
}
```


---

# 9. How To Run

From project root:

```bash
javac -d out src/main/java/com/miniredis/**/*.java
```

Run the phase driver:

```bash
java -cp out com.miniredis.driver.Phase011Driver
```

If your shell does not expand `**`, compile individual files or use IntelliJ.

---


# 10. Step-by-Step Dry Run

Example commands:

```text
multiple clients
SET
GET
```

Internal flow:

```text
1. Client/driver creates input command.
2. Parser converts raw input into Command object.
3. CommandExecutor validates command name and arguments.
4. Executor calls the correct storage/service method.
5. Data structure is updated or queried.
6. Response is returned.
```

State transition:

```text
Before:
previous phase capability only

Operation:
Multi Client Server

After:
new Redis-like behavior is available
```

Visual execution:

```text
Command
  -> validate
  -> execute
  -> update internal state
  -> return response
```


---

# 11. Test Commands

Try these mental or driver-level commands:

```text
multiple clients
SET
GET
```

Expected behavior:

```text
command accepted
state updated or queried
response returned
```

For server phases, test with:

```bash
telnet localhost 6379
```

or:

```bash
nc localhost 6379
```

---

# 12. DSA / CP Concepts Used

```text
Thread-per-client, blocking IO, concurrency basics
```

Complexity thinking:

```text
Ask:
1. What is the core data structure?
2. What is lookup complexity?
3. What is update complexity?
4. What happens under high write/read load?
5. What is the memory cost?
```

This is exactly how DSA connects to system design.

---

# 13. System Design Relevance

This phase maps to:

```text
real backend servers, Redis clients, DB connections, API gateway connections
```

System design pattern:

```text
Requirement
  -> choose data structure
  -> define operation complexity
  -> define failure behavior
  -> define scaling path
```

---

# 14. Redis Connection With This Phase

Real Redis uses the same idea at production scale.

MiniRedis version:

```text
simple Java implementation
```

Real Redis version:

```text
optimized C implementation
event loop
carefully tuned memory layout
persistence configuration
replication protocol
cluster routing
```

This phase gives the mental model before optimization.

---

# 15. Production-Grade Concepts

Production concerns:

```text
correctness
validation
memory usage
latency
thread safety
durability
observability
failure recovery
```

Questions to ask:

```text
What if process crashes?
What if key is hot?
What if memory is full?
What if many clients connect?
What if disk is slow?
What if replica lags?
```

---

# 16. Scalability Discussion

Single-node path:

```text
single JVM
  -> thread-safe store
  -> TTL cleanup
  -> persistence
  -> metrics
```

Distributed path:

```text
replication
  -> sharding
  -> consistent hashing
  -> cluster client
  -> failover
```

Bottlenecks to watch:

```text
CPU
GC
memory
network
lock contention
disk fsync
hot keys
large values
replication backlog
```

---

# 17. Interview Notes

Good explanation structure:

```text
1. Start with the simplest design.
2. Explain the data structure.
3. Give operation complexity.
4. Discuss failure cases.
5. Add production improvements.
6. Explain scaling path.
```

Possible follow-ups:

```text
How do you make it thread-safe?
How do you persist it?
How do you evict keys?
How do you shard it?
How do you recover after crash?
How do you monitor it?
```

# 18. Common Bugs

## Bug 1 — Wrong argument count

Cause:

```text
command validation missing
```

Fix:

```text
validate args before executing
```

## Bug 2 — Shared mutable state bug

Cause:

```text
multiple threads update the same data
```

Fix:

```text
ConcurrentHashMap, locks, or atomic operations
```

## Bug 3 — Memory leak

Cause:

```text
expired or unused keys remain forever
```

Fix:

```text
TTL cleanup and eviction
```

## Bug 4 — Inconsistent recovery

Cause:

```text
write applied to memory but not persisted
```

Fix:

```text
AOF/WAL ordering and fsync policy
```
