# 1. Goal

In this phase, we build:

```text
Streams Log
```

Purpose:

```text
Add Redis Streams-style durable append-only messages.
```

This continues the MiniRedis journey from a simple parser/store into a real Redis-like backend component.

---

# 2. What We Built Previously

Earlier phases gave us:

```text
001 TCP server
002 RESP parser
003 in-memory store
```

Then each later phase adds one production capability.

Current mental model:

```text
Client command
      |
      v
Parser
      |
      v
Command object
      |
      v
Command executor
      |
      v
Redis-like internal engine
      |
      v
Response
```

---

# 3. Previous Limitation

```text
Pub/Sub loses messages if subscribers are offline.
```

This limitation matters because production Redis is not only a `Map`.

It also needs:

```text
correct command behavior
memory control
expiration
persistence
concurrency
replication
sharding
observability
```

---

# 4. What We Build In This Phase

We add:

```text
We add XADD and XREAD using an ordered stream log with IDs.
```

Commands or operations covered:

```text
XADD orders event
XREAD orders 0-0
```

---

# 5. Why This Phase Matters

This phase matters because it connects implementation to real backend systems.

Real systems need:

```text
feature correctness
clear data structures
predictable complexity
safe failure handling
production debugging
scalability path
```

MiniRedis teaches these in small increments.

Phase flow:

```text
Input
  -> validate
  -> execute Streams Log
  -> update internal state
  -> return output
```

# 7. File Structure

Recommended structure:

```text
MiniRedis/
└── src/
    └── main/
        └── java/
            └── com/
                └── miniredis/
                    ├── protocol/
                    ├── command/
                    ├── storage/
                    ├── server/
                    ├── persistence/
                    ├── cluster/
                    ├── metrics/
                    └── driver/
```

For this phase, keep only the needed packages.

# 8. Complete Java Code


## 8.1 `MessageBus.java`

### Logic before this class

Pub/Sub is volatile fanout.

Streams are durable append-only logs.

This class demonstrates both.

```java
package com.miniredis.messaging;

import java.util.*;

public class MessageBus {
    private final Map<String, List<String>> subscribers = new HashMap<>();
    private final Map<String, List<String>> streams = new HashMap<>();

    public void subscribe(String channel, String clientId) {
        subscribers.computeIfAbsent(channel, c -> new ArrayList<>()).add(clientId);
    }

    public void publish(String channel, String message) {
        for (String client : subscribers.getOrDefault(channel, List.of())) {
            System.out.println("deliver to " + client + ": " + message);
        }
    }

    public String xadd(String stream, String message) {
        String id = System.currentTimeMillis() + "-" + streams.getOrDefault(stream, List.of()).size();
        streams.computeIfAbsent(stream, s -> new ArrayList<>()).add(id + " " + message);
        return id;
    }

    public List<String> xread(String stream) {
        return new ArrayList<>(streams.getOrDefault(stream, List.of()));
    }
}
```

---

## 8.2 `Phase020Driver.java`

### Logic before this class

The driver shows Pub/Sub fanout and Streams replay.

```java
package com.miniredis.driver;

import com.miniredis.messaging.MessageBus;

public class Phase020Driver {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MessageBus bus = new MessageBus();

        bus.subscribe("orders", "client-1");
        bus.subscribe("orders", "client-2");
        bus.publish("orders", "order-created");

        String id = bus.xadd("order-stream", "order-paid");
        System.out.println("stream id = " + id);
        System.out.println("stream entries = " + bus.xread("order-stream"));
    }
}
```


---

# 9. How To Run

From project root:

```bash
javac -d out src/main/java/com/miniredis/**/*.java
```

Run the phase driver:

```bash
java -cp out com.miniredis.driver.Phase020Driver
```

If your shell does not expand `**`, compile individual files or use IntelliJ.

---


# 10. Step-by-Step Dry Run

Example commands:

```text
XADD orders event
XREAD orders 0-0
```

Internal flow:

```text
1. Client/driver creates input command.
2. Parser converts raw input into Command object.
3. CommandExecutor validates command name and arguments.
4. Executor calls the correct storage/service method.
5. Data structure is updated or queried.
6. Response is returned.
```

State transition:

```text
Before:
previous phase capability only

Operation:
Streams Log

After:
new Redis-like behavior is available
```

Visual execution:

```text
Command
  -> validate
  -> execute
  -> update internal state
  -> return response
```


---

# 11. Test Commands

Try these mental or driver-level commands:

```text
XADD orders event
XREAD orders 0-0
```

Expected behavior:

```text
command accepted
state updated or queried
response returned
```

For server phases, test with:

```bash
telnet localhost 6379
```

or:

```bash
nc localhost 6379
```

---

# 12. DSA / CP Concepts Used

```text
Append-only log, ordered IDs, cursor reading
```

Complexity thinking:

```text
Ask:
1. What is the core data structure?
2. What is lookup complexity?
3. What is update complexity?
4. What happens under high write/read load?
5. What is the memory cost?
```

This is exactly how DSA connects to system design.

---

# 13. System Design Relevance

This phase maps to:

```text
Kafka-like event streams, audit logs, async pipelines
```

System design pattern:

```text
Requirement
  -> choose data structure
  -> define operation complexity
  -> define failure behavior
  -> define scaling path
```

---

# 14. Redis Connection With This Phase

Real Redis uses the same idea at production scale.

MiniRedis version:

```text
simple Java implementation
```

Real Redis version:

```text
optimized C implementation
event loop
carefully tuned memory layout
persistence configuration
replication protocol
cluster routing
```

This phase gives the mental model before optimization.

---

# 15. Production-Grade Concepts

Production concerns:

```text
correctness
validation
memory usage
latency
thread safety
durability
observability
failure recovery
```

Questions to ask:

```text
What if process crashes?
What if key is hot?
What if memory is full?
What if many clients connect?
What if disk is slow?
What if replica lags?
```

---

# 16. Scalability Discussion

Single-node path:

```text
single JVM
  -> thread-safe store
  -> TTL cleanup
  -> persistence
  -> metrics
```

Distributed path:

```text
replication
  -> sharding
  -> consistent hashing
  -> cluster client
  -> failover
```

Bottlenecks to watch:

```text
CPU
GC
memory
network
lock contention
disk fsync
hot keys
large values
replication backlog
```

---

# 17. Interview Notes

Good explanation structure:

```text
1. Start with the simplest design.
2. Explain the data structure.
3. Give operation complexity.
4. Discuss failure cases.
5. Add production improvements.
6. Explain scaling path.
```

Possible follow-ups:

```text
How do you make it thread-safe?
How do you persist it?
How do you evict keys?
How do you shard it?
How do you recover after crash?
How do you monitor it?
```

# 18. Common Bugs

## Bug 1 — Wrong argument count

Cause:

```text
command validation missing
```

Fix:

```text
validate args before executing
```

## Bug 2 — Shared mutable state bug

Cause:

```text
multiple threads update the same data
```

Fix:

```text
ConcurrentHashMap, locks, or atomic operations
```

## Bug 3 — Memory leak

Cause:

```text
expired or unused keys remain forever
```

Fix:

```text
TTL cleanup and eviction
```

## Bug 4 — Inconsistent recovery

Cause:

```text
write applied to memory but not persisted
```

Fix:

```text
AOF/WAL ordering and fsync policy
```

# 19. Next Step

Next phase:

```text
021
```

Continue the MiniRedis roadmap until the final production architecture.
